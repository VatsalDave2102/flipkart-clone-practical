# flipkart-clone-practical
This is a clone of flipkart e-commerce site. I have used 810px width for tablet and 420px for mobile views. This is made using plain HTML & CSS. 
For responsivness, I have used media queries. 

For some reasons, this is not **purely responsive** on **Google Chrome browser**, the layout tends to shrink as screen size decreases. I have used **Firefox** for inspecting, dubugging and styling. I will keep trying to resolve the issue as I progress and learn more.

As screen size reduces, I have hidden some components, put some in dropdown lists/ hamburger menus to make the UI user-friendly.
